# Internship_task1_cleaning_and_processing
The repository is all about data cleaning and data preprocessing, it is the crucial step to build any Machine Learning algorithms.
Step 1: Imported all necessary libraries to perform the task 
Step 2: Data preprocessing involves, understanding about the dataset in detail by displaying info, looking for missing values
Step 3: Data Cleaning involves removing or replacing missing values, the missing value is replaced by calculating mean and mode of the data 
Step 4: Encoding, Encoding plays a crucial role in data cleaning, it transforms data into meaningful format
Step 5: Visualizing the outliers of the dataset using box plot and rectifying the outliers by calculating the quartiles.
